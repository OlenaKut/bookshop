    aboutTheAuthor:
      "Simon 'Si' Spurrier writes novels and comics. His work in the latter field stretches from award winning creator-owned books such as Numbercruncher, Six-Gun Gorilla and The Spire to projects in the U.S. mainstream like Hellblazer, The Dreaming, and X-Men. It all began with a series of twist-in-the-tail stories for the UK's beloved 2000AD, which ignited an enduring love for genre fiction. His latest book, Coda, is being published by Boom! Studios at present. His prose works range from the beatnik neurosis-noir of Contract to the occult whodunnit A Serpent Uncoiled via various franchise and genre-transgressing titles. In 2016 he took a foray into experimental fiction with the e-novella Unusual Concentrations: a tale of coffee, crime and overhead conversations. He lives in Margate, regards sushi as part of the plotting process, and has the fluffiest of cats: https: //www.simonspurrier.com/, https: //twitter.com/sispurrier, https: //www.simonspurrier.com/blog",
