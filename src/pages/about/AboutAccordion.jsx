        <Accordion.Header><strong>How does Bookshop work with independent bookstores?</strong></Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Body className="text-start">
        Bookshop supports indies in two ways:
— 10% of direct and affiliate sales on Bookshop.org are added to an earnings pool that is evenly divided and distributed to independent bookstores every six months.
— Stores that are affiliates also can share their Bookshop.org links on social media, email newsletters, or on their websites to earn 30% of the cover price (the full profit margin) on any sales they generate, without having to do the work of keeping inventory, picking, packing, shipping or handling complaints and returns.
All books are sent from our wholesaler Ingram, not the bookstore's actual inventory.

        <Accordion.Header><strong>Do affiliates have to disclose this websites, newsletters or social media posts?</strong></Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Body className="text-start">
Yes. Whenever a link is used on your website that results in a commission, you must disclose this information to site visitors, according to FTC rules. We suggest adding something like: "Disclosure: I am an affiliate of Bookshop.org where your purchases support local bookstores. I will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase." to your website or post.        </Accordion.Body>

        <Accordion.Header><strong>If I'm an affiliate, how are the sales of my books handled?</strong></Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Body className="text-start">
Affiliates do not have to handle inventory, fulfillment, shipping, or customer service. All book sales are fulfilled by Ingram. Ingram's extensive inventory and regional warehouse system ensures Bookshop.org that books can reach customers in as soon as 2-3 days.        </Accordion.Body>

        <Accordion.Header><strong>FAQ for Bookstore</strong></Accordion.Header>
        <Accordion.Body className="text-start">
Bookstores with physical locations who are ABA members (with one of the following ABA memberships: Provisional, Pop-up, Mobile, or Storefront) qualify as a bookseller on our platform and can be added to our bookstore finder map, receive a 30% commission on sales, and receive customer order information. Please email Justin Walls at justin.walls@bookshop.org if you qualify.

—Bookshop.org's conversion rate for bookstore shop pages averages 12%. That's twice the industry average, and means that our stores earn more sales and revenue, without any overhead.
—Our stores' curated book lists can go viral; a few have driven six-figure sales for several of our stores. They also can rank high on Google search results.
—Over 1000 customers choose a bookstore to support on our store finder map every day.
—We're always upgrading: since we launched, we've added many improvements for our stores, and we have lots more planned in 2022.</Accordion.Body>
