          <p className="text-start mb-3 m-auto mx-5">
            Bookshop.org began as an idea to help support bookstores and their
            communities as more and more people are buying their books online.
            We saw an opportunity to create an alternative to Amazon for
            socially-conscious online shoppers. Amazon sells over 60% of all
            books in the US and is growing. That shift threatens the future of
            bookstores and will hurt readers, authors, and publishers who rely
            on a diverse, healthy ecosystem for books. <span className="fw-bold">We had a better idea — give readers the convenience of online shopping while supporting independent bookstores at the same time.</span>
          </p>
          <p className="text-start mb-3 m-auto mx-5">
            We launched in January of 2020, with just 88 bookstore partners and
            a team of four passionate book people.
          </p>
          <p className="text-start mb-3 m-auto mx-5">
            As the COVID-19 pandemic surged, our growing platform helped our
            community of independent booksellers survive shutdowns. That spring,
            traffic to Bookshop.org hit 1 million users in a single day. By the
            end of 2020 we had grown to over 1,000 bookstores and distributed
            over ten million dollars in profits. Bookshop.org has since expanded
            internationally, launching in the UK and Spain.
          </p>
          <p className="text-start mb-3 m-auto mx-5">
            78% of our customers said they regularly bought books from Amazon
            before they made the switch.
